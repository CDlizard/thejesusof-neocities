      <h1>SPOILERS FOR THE FNAF4 VIDEOS GAME</h1>
      <p>The Fourth installment of the original clickteam FNaF series, Fnaf 4 brings us a FUCK ton of narrative and an entirely new style of game to "tie in" the FNaF series. <br> The game is centered around the Crying Child's perspective of The Bite of '83, demonstrating the damage of the bite itself alongside the paralyzing environment leading up to it effectively through the gameplay as the player follows in his mind.<br> What's so different about the gameplay in this game, compared to the previous 3 installments of the franchise, is all in the scene change. First and foremost, there are NO cameras. Thus, this sets the player's sudden ability to move, walking and running around. The player is now able to get up and move, forced by the lack of cameras to check for the monsters themselves behind the closet or bedroom doors, only momentarily holding the door shut. The removal of the camera system also prompts the introduction of a new, terrifying game mechanic: auditory cues.</p>
