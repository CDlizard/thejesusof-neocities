      <h1>SPOILERS FOR THE FNAF4 VIDEOS GAME</h1>
      <p>The Fourth installment of the original clickteam FNaF series, Fnaf 4 brings us a FUCK ton of narrative and an entirely new style of game to "tie in" the FNaF series. <br> The game is centered around the Crying Child's perspective of The Bite of '83, demonstrating the damage of the bite itself alongside the paralyzing environment leading up to it effectively through the gameplay as the player follows in his mind.<br> What's so different about the gameplay in this game, compared to the previous 3 installments of the franchise, is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The freedom of movement! Before in the series the player was confined to their office space, checking the map through the cameras, constantly aware of the environment around them. In Fnaf 4, there is not only a lack of cameras</li>
      </ul>
